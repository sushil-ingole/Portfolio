                    <h1>Jealousy</h1>
                    <small>23, 2020</small>
                    <p>The thing about jealousy is that when you find someone doing something soo good but then till that point it is always okay, the part of jealousy starts when we start to think about us doing the same thing like others within our mind, and mostly we get jealous to someone even before we trying to attempt the same thing with our whole dedication, and still we already try to think that damn I'll not be able to do this, like this thinking process we don't do consciously but our subconscious mind does that. So instead of feeling happy for them, jealousy comes in between, because we immediately try to compare ourself to the other person without giving our full attempt to do that thing and coming to a conclusion that yeah if I would try it then I could have also done that. So the thing is try to accept the things as they are, like someone is doing something out of their creative ideas, which is making them happy and which you can also do if you wanted to or it's just a god gift to them the same way you're gifted with something, but it's all about individual's wants what they choose to do and in which thing they want to explore themselves with full dedication and intensities. So don't ever feel jealous before coming to a conclusion without giving a try to that thing and respect the people that they choose something which is making us feel good cause that's why only we got jealous somewhere know and they're improving in their life in a positive way which you can also do if you want. So it's always about our choice.</p>

                    <small>24, 2020</small>
                    <p>We can't defeat someone cause we can't have an actual race with someone, when we try to defeat someone, we only get superior than we were previously, we don't get superior than someone else whom we defeat, cause everyone is very much unique. The defeating process is just an assumption made out of looking at the competitors on the same platform, but the actual thing is they're not on the same, so the thing they're doing is pointless if their ultimate purpose is to defeat their assumed competitors, purpose should always be try our best so that we can be a little bit of something from different talents we are all surrounded with in the process of trying to defeat them, so that it could help ourself somewhere in future somehow and then we should accept what we have achieved cause it is never our race in which we're competing with someone else and then if we still got something out of it, isn't it such a fruitful thing for our soul.</p>

                    <h1>Misconceptions</h1>
                    <p>Oct 25, 2020</p>
                    <p>We are all always living our life considering our future existence, and our actions and choices are also accordingly moulded even if we wanted something else in present, our assumptions are carrying our life forward where we are never living what we actually want to do at the present moment, what we are doing is currently under some pressure of our future assumptions which is a probability. This estimated reality of life is always trying us to not live what we want to live at present in fear of our future consequences and insecurities, sometimes we also don't care about our existence but the soo called emotional bonds we have made with some close ones make us live, that fear of others hurt is our drive. The reality is we never strongly want soo many things from our life in core, it's just that our imagination is making us do things which is a preparation of probability and not the exact thing at the moment.</p>
